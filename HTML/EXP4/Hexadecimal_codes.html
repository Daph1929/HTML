<h1>Major Hexadecimal Color Codes</h1>

<center><p><u>Hex triplet</u><</p></center>

<p>A hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the True Color (24-bit RGB) color scheme. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:</p>
<pre><p>
    Byte 1: red value (color type red)
    Byte 2: green value (color type green)
    Byte 3: blue value (color type blue) </p></pre><br><br>

<p>For example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the 6 hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.<br>

If any one of the three color values is less than 16 (hex) or 10 (decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.<br>

The number of colors that can be represented by this system is 2563 or 224 or 166 = 16,777,216. <br><br>
<u>Shorthand hexadecimal form</u><br></p>

<p>An abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.[4] Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC as presented on the following CSS example:</p>

<pre><p>.threedigit { color: #09C;    }
.sixdigit   { color: #0099CC; } </p></pre><br><br><br><br>

<p>The three-digit form is described in the CSS specification, not in HTML. As a result, the three-digit form in an attribute other than "style" is not interpreted as a valid color in some browsers.<br>

This shorthand form reduces the palette to 4,096 colors, equivalent of 12-bit color as opposed to 24-bit color using the whole six-digit form (16,777,216 colors), this limitation is sufficient for many text based documents.<br><br>
<u>Converting RGB to hexadecimal</u>
<br><br>

RGB values are usually given in the 0–255 range; if they are in the 0–1 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives us the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers ten to fifteen. See hexadecimal for more details). The remainder gives us the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into twelve groups of sixteen, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives us the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.<br><br><br><br>
