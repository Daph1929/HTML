<p><i>HTML color codes are hexadecimal triplets representing the colors red, green, and blue (#RRGGBB). For example, in the color red, the color code is #FF0000, which is '255' red, '0' green, and '0' blue. These color codes can be used to change the color of the background, text, and tables on a web page.</i>
<p><i><b>HOW TO APPLY THESE CODES AND COLORS</b><br>

HTML color codes are hexadecimal triplets representing the colors red, green, and blue. For example, in the below example of the color red, you can notice the color code is FF0000, which is '255' red, '0' green, and '0' blue.

To change the font color, add the below source code:
<font color="#FF0000">Making the text color red</font>

In addition, with new browsers you now have the capability of changing the color by using the name, such as:
<font color="red">Making the text color red</font>

Other ways to use these codes is within your BODY statement. This allows you to change the complete page:
<BODY TEXT="#000000" LINK="red" VLINK="blue" BGCOLOR="#ffffff" >

TEXT="000000" When used will display all text on page as black.
LINK="#1F00FF" When used will change all links to red. 
VLINK="blue" When used will change all viewed links to blue.
BGCOLOR="#ffffff" When used will display the page with a white background.</i><br>
<p><i>Hex code byte values range from 00, which is the lowest intensity of a color, to FF which represents the highest intensity. The color white, for example, is made by mixing each of the three primary colors at their full intensity, resulting in the Hex color code of #FFFFFF.<br>
Black, the absence of any color on a screen display, is the complete opposite, with each color displayed at their lowest possible intensity and a Hex color code of #000000.<br>
Understanding the basics of Hex color code notation we can create grayscale colors very easily, since they consist of equal intensities of each color<br>
With modern browsers supporting the full spectrum of 24-bit color, there are 16,777,216 different color possibilities.
